            class-1 attack -> unlock CG
            class-w attack -> unlock meta CG
            class-w^x attack -> unlock meta^x CG
            class-w^w attack -> unlock typeless CG
    make w
        reach infinity
    chain the CG to get w^2, w^3
    meta CG
    make 2 ^ w
    make w ^ w
        reach uncountability
    typeless CG


mana
real-time preview of circuit flow
CG: fast, weak, mean. 
    minimum superposition equilibrium
to implement mu
    linear system of eqs

high fire rate will make inf attacks more prominent against finite attacks. 

circuit: from radiator to mana crystalizer

npc
    give you fast travel Mk I, Mk II (20% buff! try it! you already have omega)
