How to make the player come up with inf themselves? 
    roadblock w/ inf enemies? 
        what about the excitement "I made inf and I'm OP"?
        you are not OP if the enemy has inf. 
    roadblock w/ HARD, finite enemies. 
    How to communicate: stop grinding, think!

mana

high fire rate will make inf attacks more prominent against finite attacks. 

circuit: from radiator to mana crystalizer

jump
    NPC give you Jump Mk I
    Mk II (20% buff! try it! but you already have omega)

shops and NPCs spawn seemingly stochastically, but actually scripted
    when an event is active, spawn no more enemies, wait until all enemies dead, then spawns the event. 
    if you leave the shop without buying anything, ok, spawn some enemies, then shop again. 
    implementation: "next spawnable NPC". Can be probabilistic while spawning enemies. 

UI
    only reveals the prices you can afford

skills
    attack
    jump
    light

attack
    spell speed \propto mana. Leaves glowing trail. So, omega spells visually become lasers. 

concentric circles
    become parallel lines
    hint destinations

opening
    "You feel the game will feature amazing plot twists in the story."
    "However, you can't shake off the suspicion that your previous thought was injected by the narrator."

wands
    upgradable into the next tier at Wand Smiths.
    Crude wand
    Lucifer's secret
    Rice cooker

enemies spawn when you move, in the direction you are moving towards. 

Gem Expert
    "Nice try..."
    "But I'm afraid that was still just as strong as a *class-x attack*."

    "!!!"
    "You just struck me with"
    "a *class-X attack*."

    if x >= w^2, "You see, if you hit me with a class-w^x attack, I will unlock Meta^x Custom Gems."
