we cannot use binary search to gain LFS solutions. When a solution is rejected, you don't know if you should increase or decrease the guess. e.g. a constant-value mana stream enters a focuser. 

what we really need is the least F-closed superposition.
x: the superposition guess.
F: eval the mana flow given the guess. 
F(x) yields the entry mana for all focusers. 
if F(x) <= x for all focusers, then accept. 
My hope: if x_0 is accepted, then any x_1 > x_0 is also accepted.
