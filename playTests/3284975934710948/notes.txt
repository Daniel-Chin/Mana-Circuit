1st crash
    end of 1.mkv
    2nd crash
    end of 2.mkv

did not see tooltip of empty space
    2.mkv 2:10

make mirror cheaper, in case of the soft soft lock 3.mkv 12:00

the game did not emphasize quantitative analysis. Even this subject did not do math at 3.mkv 15:00
    10:48 similar occurance. 迟迟不放乘法！
    maybe "you should form the habit of analyzing the mean mana output"

another possible solution to limit the search space is to make the center of ricecooker a blockage

once mean-inf, "what is the mean output now?" should be said by wand smith. 

3.mkv 31:50
    maybe shop hint should also consider design time at wand smith?

3.mkv 33:25
    how to we make the player compute mean ASAP? once mean-inf, "what is the mean output now?" should be said by wand smith. 
    OR EVEN, popup the dialog immediately when an inf-mean design appears in the designer. This communicates (/hints) the optimality of the current design. 

"computing the mean is not that difficult. At its worst, just 等比数列求和."

bug. hitting gem expert with a w^6 attack after chain-unlock w^9 triggers "!!!" dialog

game expert should mention "press ESC to see related works."
