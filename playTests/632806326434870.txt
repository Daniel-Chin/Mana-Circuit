click away from shop selection dialog

cancelling selection of orientation places the gem in default orientation

talking to the shop reveals hint. but Subject doesn't go to the shop while holding max-finite ricecooker, because he has all the gems already. 

remove half money when die

can find loop by himself but doesn't see the threshold of 2. Maybe encourage to analyze mean sooner? actually, hint that "mult is strong when it's repeated".

to spawn inventor MkII, I check up to w^4. but Subject directly jumped to w^9. 

dropped money needs to be wider, for w^w^w^w^w^w

circuitUI aspect ratio bug???

GemExpert should:
    explain CG can contain gem & be placed in wand.
    Explain meta for those who skip.
    don't say "theoretical mean" every time
    explain typeless = meta^w, can contain meta^(w-1)

clear world attacks when jump

loading custom gems should be sorted by metaLevel, otherwise prior gems could reference later gems.
